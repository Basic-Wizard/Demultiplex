Part 1: Quality Score Distribution per-nucleotide
-------------------------------------------------

Data exploration:
/projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz 
zcat 1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz | head

Number of reads in each file
    zcat 1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz | wc -l (will take a longggg time to run)
Determine the length of the reads in each file
    zcat 1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz | head -2 | tail -1 | wc (then subtract 1 because '/n' at end of the line)
    zcat 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | head -2 | tail -1 | wc
    zcat 1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz | head -2 | tail -1 | wc
    zcat 1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz | head -2 | tail -1 | wc

Determine the phred encoding for these data
    if it is phred 64, there will be lowercase letters in the quality score lines
    also no hashtags in phred64
    to search for these lowercase letters in only the quality score lines:
        zcat 1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '4~4p' | grep -E "[a-z]+" --> if it finds nothing, then it is phred 33
        zcat 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '4~4p' | grep -E "[a-z]+"
        zcat 1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '4~4p' | grep -E "[a-z]+"
        zcat 1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '4~4p' | grep -E "[a-z]+"

Generate a per base distribution of quality scores for read1, read2, index1, and index2. 
Average the quality scores at each position for all reads and generate a per nucleotide mean distribution as you did in part 1 of PS4 (in Bi621)
    -will need bioinfo.py --> copy it into this repository
    -add the populate_list function into this module
    #indexes may be reverse compliments of each other??

Note: Since reading through zipped files, will need to use gzip module
    -When reading each line, turn the zipped bits into the ascii characters
        line = line.decode("ascii")
        OR 
        with gzip.open(args.file, "rt") as opened: --> I used this form for my code (rt = read text mode)

zcat 1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz | head -2 | tail -1 | wc --> gives 102, but minus 1 bc '/n' character at end

I ran into a couple of issues with running out of memory, so I had to rewrite portions of my code
    -get rid of 2D list (don't want to keepindividual qscores, instead just have a running sum in a 1D list)

creating the histograms: *Job number, command --> command in the bash script*
21756419, sbatch read1.sh --> ./Demultiplex_pt1.py -f '/projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz' -l 101 -g 'Read1'
    -took about 2 hours to run
21756421, sbatch index1.sh --> ./Demultiplex_pt1.py -f '/projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz' -l 8 -g 'Index1'
    -took about 20 minutes to run
21756422, sbatch index2.sh --> ./Demultiplex_pt1.py -f '/projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz' -l 8 -g 'Index2'
    -took about 20 minutes to run
21756420, sbatch read2.sh --> ./Demultiplex_pt1.py -f '/projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz' -l 101 -g 'Read2'
    -took about 2 hours to run

How many indexes have undetermined (N) base calls? (only on Index1, Index2)
    zcat 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | sed -n "2~4p" | grep -c "N" --> 3976613
    zcat 1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz | sed -n "2~4p" | grep -c "N" --> 3328051

--------------------------------------------------------
Part 2: Develop an algorithm to de-multiplex the samples
--------------------------------------------------------

- Define the problem
    * writing an algorithm to de-multiplex files and report index-hopping
    * demultiplex reads by index-pair
    * Need to compare index 1 and index 2 for each read to see if they match or don't match
    * Separately the 4 reads into categorized files based on certain filtering conditions

- Determine/describe what output would be informative
    * outputting 52 total files:
        -one R1 FASTQ file per matching index-pair
        -one R2 FASTQ file per matching index-pair
        -two additional FASTQ files for non-matching index-pairs (index-hopping), 
        -two additional FASTQ files when one or both index reads are unknown or low quality 
            *do not match the 24 known indexes [this includes indexes with 'N's in them] or do not meet a quality score cutoff.

- Write examples (unit tests!):
    - Include four properly formatted input FASTQ files with read pairs that cover all three categories (dual matched, index-hopped, unknown index)
    - Include the appropriate number of properly formatted output FASTQ files given your input files

- Develop your algorithm using pseudocode
    * R1, R2, I1, I2
        -index contains N? --> unknown 
            should we use validated base seq function?
        -Qscores < 30 --> unknown (low quality)
            is it Qscore per base position or the average Qscore of the entire line? --> 
            is it just for the Index files? or all files?
        -does index 1 match reverse comp of index 2? --> if not matched, index hopping
        -does reverse comp of index 2 match the 24 known? --> if not in the known 24, send to unknown file
            make list of 24 known & check if indexes are contained in that list
    * Add headers (to all files) and send to corresponding files

    -Open all 4 files and will be looping through the records
    -Read the sequence line of the nth record for all 4 files
    -Records with at least one Index with N in sequence --> into the unknown file
        -if indexes dont match --> hopping file
        -if indexes match, but not in known 24 --> unknown file
        -if indexes match and in known 24 --> send it index_index_R#.fq

    -Compare both indexes (index 1, index 2) to the known 24 index dictionary
        -if index 1 in keys, 
            if index 2 in value --> check next condition
        -if either is not in corresponding list --> unknown file
    -Records with at least one Index with N in sequence --> into the unknown file
    
    -Check if indexes match:
        -if indexes dont match --> hopping file
        -if indexes match (already know they're in the original 24 indexes) --> send to index_index_Read#.fq
            *for adding to the header lines: @header_index1_index2(revcomp)

*Final version of pseudocode (as of 7/29/22)*
    -Open all 4 files and read in parallel (will be looping through the records)
    -Read the sequence line of the nth record for all 4 files
    -Create set of 24 known indexes (forward/given)
    -Create 3 counters to keep track of number of reads going into each file: matched, unmatched, unknown
    -Collect all 4 lines of the record into 4 temporary arrays of size 4 (will save each line as a position in the array)
    -For each record:
        -if any base pair position has Qscore < 30 for either index --> unknown file, increment unknown counter
        -Check if any N's in the index 1 or index 2. If either containts an N --> unknown file, increment unknown counter
        -Check if index 1 in set:
            -if index 1 is not in the set --> unknown file, increment unknown counter
            -if index 1 in set --> continue filtering
                -Check if rev comp Index 2 is in set:
                    -If rec comp Index 2 not in set --> unknown file, increment unknown counter
                    -If rev comp Index 2 is in set --> check if matching
                        -Check if matching: does index 1 == rev comp index 2
                            -Yes --> index1_rcindex2_Read#.fq (matched files) (rcindex2 = reverse complement of Act2), , increment matched counter
                            -No --> unmatched file, increment unmatched counter 

- Determine high level functions
    - Description/doc string â€“ What does this function do?
    - Function headers (name and parameters)
    - Test examples for individual functions
* Reverse complement function:
     ```Take in DNA sequence as input (5' - 3'). Return reverse complement of input sequence (5' - 3').```
     def rev_comp(str: sequence) -> str
     rev_comp(AAGGTCTGA)
        * input: AAGGTCTGA --> return: TCAGACCTT
     rev_comp(TGATTTTGCAGGA)
        * input: TGATTTTGCAGGA --> return: TCCTGCAAAATCA
     return revs_comp

Conditions to check in the unit test:
    -unknown = seq1
    -matched = seq2
    -unmatched (index hopping) = seq3
